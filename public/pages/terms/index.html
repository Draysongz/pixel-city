            <li><strong>User Responsibility for Uploaded Content:</strong> The website is not responsible for uploaded
                pictures, copyright, or other legal disputes. Each user is responsible for the content they upload.</li>
            <li><strong>Prohibition of Sensitive Content:</strong> Pictures containing sensitive content are not
                allowed. If such content is uploaded, it will not be posted, and the team will inform the owner. Users
                can change the picture, but refunds will not be issued.</li>
            <li><strong>Restrictions on Images of Children:</strong> Uploading pictures of children is prohibited unless
                proof is provided that the person is at least 18 years old or the child is accompanied by a legal parent
                or guardian.</li>
            <li><strong>Inappropriate Links:</strong> Links associated with uploaded pictures must not direct to
                websites with inappropriate or sensitive content.</li>
            <li><strong>Final Decision on Content:</strong> The Website team reserves the right to make the final
                decision on whether a picture or link is appropriate for posting.</li>
            <li><strong>Permanence of Uploaded Pictures:</strong> Once uploaded, pictures on the wall are permanent and
                cannot be changed, unless technical functionality allows or individual agreements are made.</li>
            <li><strong>Use of Submitted Information:</strong> Information submitted during checkout (picture, link,

                Website.</li>
            <li><strong>Picture Location Adjustments:</strong> The Website team may adjust the location of pictures on
                the Pixel Wall at any time, ensuring the overall size of purchased pictures is not reduced.</li>

                team has the right to remove or reduce its size.</li>

        <h2>Fees and Payment</h2>
        <p>Payment for the Million Pixel Wall Services is an essential and mandatory step for owning a picture on the
            Website, unless otherwise agreed upon.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Service Payment in INJ:</strong> The payment amount for the Services is displayed in Injective
                cryptocurrency (INJ).</li>
            <li><strong>Checkout Process:</strong> During the checkout process, after completing the picture upload,
                clients proceed to the Payment step. The service price is automatically calculated based on the pixel
                amount chosen at the start of the checkout and displayed in the checkout area.</li>
            <li><strong>Official Payment Address:</strong> Payments should only be made to the official payment address
                provided in the Payment checkout step. The official Million Pixel INJ wallet address is

            </li>
            <li><strong>No Refunds Post Payment:</strong> Once a payment transaction is completed, the Service does not
                offer a refund option, as the client has completed the checkout, agreed to the terms and conditions, and
                executed the payment.</li>
            <li><strong>Refunds for Incorrect Payments:</strong> Refunds are issued only in cases where an incorrect
                payment amount, not matching the order sum, is made. In such situations, clients should contact the
                Website team for resolution.</li>
            <li><strong>Accepted Payment Forms:</strong> Payments are accepted in INJ or other cryptocurrencies, subject
                to individual agreement.</li>
        </ul>
